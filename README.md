### Projects and Portfolio Products
1. Long Short Term Memory Stock Prediction Dashboard: https://github.com/bmorrow5/LSTM-ML-Stock-Dashboard 
   - Utilizes the Python Panel package as well as Plotly and HVplot to create a stock dashboard with interactive data visualizations
   - Global filters update plots in real time for a time period and interval
   - Uses LSTM Machine Learning to predict future stock prices (further hyper parameter tuning needed depending on time period and interval)
   - Web scrapes the biggest gainers and biggest losers for the day and plots them
   - Web scrapes the sector and industry performances for the day
   - Utilizes regex and error handling to ensure web scraped data valid
2. Strategic Procurement Optimization System (SPOS): Leveraging Game Theory for Enhanced Supplier Negotiation and Decision Making (In Private Repo due to env vars)
   - Uses Bayesian Fuzzy Games, Game Theory to automate price negotiations. This uses Bayesian Networks with Fuzzy Mathematics in a two-player zero sum mixed strategy game.
   - Designing a system to automate the procurement price negotiation process
4. Data Engineering COVID Data database: https://github.com/bmorrow5/Data-Engineering/tree/main/EN.685.648.81.FA23-main 
   - A group project that pulls COVID data from the CDC, stock data from yahoo, emmissions data from the EPA, and US economic data from the federal government
   - Pulls data from the four sources and creates a database that will update weekly
   - I created the automation that updates the database weekly utlizing Airflow (located in airflow_scripts)
   - I created the SQL that creates the database
   - I created the code that pulls the EPA data
5. Examples of statistical modeling and reporting: https://github.com/bmorrow5/Data-Science-Reports-and-Final-Products
6. Tableau and Power BI dashboards displaying AirBnB data are located:
